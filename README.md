# FAO Reproducing Charts using Charts.js
This code was made to provide an easy way of reproducing interactive charts for future reports. Based on Observable Plot, a sub-library of D3.js.

## Chart.js
Chart.js has three Chart Types so far,
- Bar Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Stacked Bar Chart
- [x] #5

> How do you use Chart.js?

### Usage of Chart.js

1. Import Chart.js into your JavaScript 
    - You can do this by typing
    - ` import { BarChart, ScatterPlot, StackedBarChart } from "./Chart.js"; `

2. Provide formatting options for the chart you want to create
    - Example format can be seen below:
    ```
    const fig4_1_options = {
        XAxisName: "Board",
        YAxisName: "Per-student Funding ($)",
        legend: [["English Public", "English Catholic", "French Public", "French Catholic"], [fao_blue, fao_light_blue_1, fao_pink, fao_light_pink]],
        fill: "System",
        yAxisRange: [0, 40000],
        percent: false,
        padding: clustered_barchart_padding
    }
    ```

    - Key options with types to note are
    ```
    XAxisName: string,
    YAxisName: string,
    legend: 2D Array of strings with first row being list of Legend Names, Second Rown being associative colours
    fill: string,
    yAxisRange: 2 element array of ints,
    percent: bool,
    padding: double
    ```

3. Declare the chart defining it with what **Chart Type** you want it to be
    - Example format can be seen below:
    '''
    const fig4_1 = new BarChart(fig4_1_options, data);
    '''
    > [!NOTE]
    > Data must be loaded as a JSON, use '''d3.csv'' to load a CSV into a JSON. Learn more [here] (https://d3-wiki.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/master/CSV/)

4. Congrats :tada: you have loaded a Chart!
> [!TIP]
> To see this chart please insert it into the HTML. An example of doing this by replacing an image can be seen with the code snippet below.
> '''function replaceFig(figId,graphElement){
    //DOCSTRING: Replaces the image with the graph element
    //figId: the id of the figure
    //graphElement: the graph element to replace the image with
    const img = document.querySelector('#' + figId + '-image img');
    img.after(graphElement);
    img.style.display = "none";
    } '''
